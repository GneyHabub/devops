# Prometheus
## Components:
1. Prometheus Operator - prometheus wrapper to use it in kubernetes. Some kind of prometheus plugin for the k8s.
2. Prometheus itself. Toolkit for monitoring.
3. Alertmanager - tool for handling and managing alerts.
4. Node exporter - tool for collecting metrics from the host. Things like CPU percentage, network bandwidth and etc.
5. Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs - proxy between the prometheus and kubernetes metrics. Set of APIs so that prometheus is able to collect data from the k8s.
6. kube-state-metrics - tool to collect metrics about the k8s objects.
7. React app for visualization of analytics.

## Info about the cluster:
